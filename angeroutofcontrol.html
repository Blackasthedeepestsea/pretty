<h4>1) Mild annoyance- usually not many physical symptoms associated with this level and it’s easier to process and let go.  This is the level of anger where it’s sometimes not even necessary to put up a boundary or express it and it might be better to just let it go especially if it involves a stranger or a location you might not encounter again.</h4>

<h4>2) Pretty angry - Experiencing some physical symptoms at this point, but you still have enough control that you might be able to express a boundary in the present moment and resolve this issue immediately.</h4>

<h4>3) Very angry - Probably experiencing several physical symptoms at this point.  Usually it's not a good idea to try and talk things out at this point, and it’s better to calm down first.  If you feel the anger escalating even more, leave the situation.</h4>

<h4>4) Rage - This is the level of anger that can get you in serious trouble and even cause you to end up in jail.  Some people who get to this level of anger black-out and can’t fully remember what they said or did while they were raging.  This is the level of anger you want to prevent from getting to.  Physically fighting, destroying property, verbally attacking people with no boundaries.</h4>

    <h4><b>Do you find yourself in a rage on a regular basis? <br>
        <br>
        I would recommend immediate professional help.  You may end up doing permanent damage to a child, your family, and/or yourself. <br><br>
         If you are raging on a regular basis means there might be something wrong with you physically, your liver or your brain are two main culprits.  If there is something wrong physically this issue is beyond fixing with mental or behavioral changes. <br><br> Damage from alcohol or drugs, having been in many physical fights, having been in a car accident, or other head trauma can all seriously affect your ability to process anger.  Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive brain condition that's thought to be caused by repeated blows to the head and repeated episodes of concussion.  This is a separate but sometimes related issue to PTSD and it needs to be treated as a separate condition.</b></h4>
