                 <div class="article">   For us that grew up in environments where authority figures acted out on anger in irrational, unpredictable, and even physically violent ways anger can start to be viewed as the enemy.  In reality we were created to experience anger to protect us.  Anger is an indicator that there is a threat in our environment and if we can </div>
                    <ol>
                  <li> 1) learn to recognize that we are angry </li> 
                  <li>  2) figure out the reason we are angry</li> 
                    <li>  3) act appropriately based on what our body and mind are trying to tell us</li> 
                    </ol>
                    We can protect ourselves and our loved ones better.  Anger gives us the energy to act, and if we can turn our anger into positive action our lives will change in a constructive way.

                    1. Make a list of indicators you have noticed when you start to experience anger.
                    2. Make a list of possible physical issues that may be affecting your levels of anger and then  actions you can take to work on the issues. Examples below.
                    
                    Issue - Monthly terrible PMS 
                    Action - Do yoga and I will go to acupuncture which helps reduce the anger, moodiness, and painful cramps I experience before having my period. 
                    
                    Issue - After coming back from the war I was prescribed this medication for depression but ever since I started taking it, I’m angry all the time.
                    Action - I will make an appointment with my psychiatrist and make sure my dose is lowered or I am taken off this completely.  I will look into alternative ways to combat my depression.
                    
                    
                   <p>Recognizing Why We Are Experiencing Anger</p> 
                    
                    Levels of Anger and Strategies to Use at the Level in the Moment
                    
                    1)Mild annoyance- usually not many physical symptoms associated with this level and it’s easier to process and let go.  This is the level of anger where it’s sometimes not even necessary to put up a boundary or express it and it might be better to just let it go especially if it involves a stranger or a location you might not encounter again.
                    
                    2)Pretty angry - Experiencing some physical symptoms at this point, but you still have enough control that you might be able to express a boundary in the present moment and resolve this issue immediately.
                    
                    3)Very angry - Probably experiencing several physical symptoms at this point.  Usually it's not a good idea to try and talk things out at this point, and it’s better to calm down first.  If you feel the anger escalating even more, leave the situation.
                    
                    4)Rage - This is the level of anger that can get you in serious trouble and even cause you to end up in jail.  Some people who get to this level of anger black-out and can’t fully remember what they said or did while they were raging.  This is the level of anger you want to prevent from getting to.  Physically fighting, destroying property, verbally attacking people with no boundaries.
                    
                    
                   <p> Activity: </p>
                   Think about the last week and right down three experiences where you felt angry on some level.  Analyze how angry you were and then try to pinpoint the exact thing that was making you angry in the moment.  Then pinpoint what it may remind you about a traumatic situation in the past.
                    
                    If you find yourself getting to the level of very angry and rage on a regular basis then I would recommend immediate professional help.  You may end up doing permanent damage to a child, your family, and/or yourself.  Getting to the level of rage on a regular basis means there might be something wrong with you physically, your liver or your brain are two main culprits.  If there is something wrong physically you won’t be able to think your way out of the problem or change your behavior out of the problem because this issue is beyond fixing with mental or behavioral changes.  Damage from alcohol or drugs, or having been in many physical fights, or having been in a car accident or some other head trauma can all seriously affect your ability to process anger.  Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive brain condition that's thought to be caused by repeated blows to the head and repeated episodes of concussion.  This is a separate but sometimes related issue to PTSD and it needs to be treated as a separate condition if you have it.
                    
                    
                    
                  <p> Long Term Strategies to Reduce Levels of Anger </p> 
                    
                    Once you understand what triggers your anger and fear you can start making long term changes to make sure you don’t end up in triggering situations. 
                    
                    Putting up boundaries with people - The quicker you can put up a boundary with someone when you are experiencing mild levels of anger the better.  If the person then respects the boundary then that should solve the issue.  Otherwise the anger grows and grows and the other person might not be aware they are making us angry if we aren’t communicating it.
                    
                    Avoiding situations that we know will make us angry - For example if I know that I get easily angry in situations that are very noisy, I shouldn’t apply to a job in a bowling alley or a nightclub with loud music.  Once you pinpoint the thing that triggers you, it’s okay to make your life easier by trying to avoid having to be around that trigger on a regular basis.
                    
                    Having a plan if we know that we are going into a situation that will trigger us - If you know you are going to have to enter a triggering situation make sure you plan ahead.  Meditate or do a slow breathing exercise, get enough sleep the night before, talk to a supportive friend, listen to music you like, and then go into the situation and put up boundaries.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                  <p> Take-Aways- </p> 
                    
                    1.  A list of personal indicators that you are experiencing anger.
                    2.  A list of strategies to cope with and hopefully benefit from different levels of anger in different situations.
                    3. Do something kind for yourself as a reward for having gone through this worksheet since you now have an increased awareness of how PTSD relates to anger and an understanding that we are responsible for how we handle our response to our possible overreaction but we are not responsible for that initial overreaction which comes from PTSD itself.  This should decrease your shame and fear over time as you are able to spot and handle these overreactions in increasingly constructive ways and gain control over your life.
