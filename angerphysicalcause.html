           <p>    1. Make a list of indicators you have noticed when you start to experience anger.
               2. Make a list of possible physical issues that may be affecting your levels of anger and then  actions you can take to work on the issues. Examples below.</li>
               
               Issue - Monthly terrible PMS 
               Action - Do yoga and I will go to acupuncture which helps reduce the anger, moodiness, and painful cramps I experience before having my period. 
               
               Issue - After coming back from the war I was prescribed this medication for depression but ever since I started taking it, I’m angry all the time.
               Action - I will make an appointment with my psychiatrist and make sure my dose is lowered or I am taken off this completely.  I will look into alternative ways to combat my depression.</p>
